        We are glad to present to you our new web service - the Contact site.
        This site was created to give you maximum convenience in managing your
        contacts. Now you will be able to efficiently add, easily sort and, if
        necessary, delete your contacts, without spending excessive time and
        effort. Do not waste time on monotonous movement through the list - we
        will do it for you. And that's not all! To have access to the full range
        of features of our site, we advise you to register. Registration will
        allow you to keep your contacts safe, receive updates and new features
        that we are constantly introducing. You will have full control over your
        data and will be able to use the site 100%.
